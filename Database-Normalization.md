# Database-Normalization
Database Normalization is structuring data in a way to make the most frequently used data more accessible and simplified. Normalization is taking data through a set of forms called “normal forms”. The process of normalization includes: getting rid of redundant data, containing and organizing data so that it is easy to find and edit, and getting rid of information that isn’t needed. There are three types of forms that information can be put into, these forms have rules to make information easier to access through searching and can also make it easier to predict things like customer behavior.
